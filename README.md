# Acyclic coloring

## Description

This project implements 3 algorithms responsible for finding acyclic chromatic number of graphs. The acyclic chromatic number of a graph G is the smallest size of vertex partition V_1, V_2, ..., V_n such that each V_i is an independent set and for all i, j that graph G[V_i \ V_j] does not contain a cycle. In graph theory, an acyclic coloring is vertex coloring coloring in which every 2-chromatic subgraph is acyclic.

```
dotnet run
```
in the root directory. You can also do 
```
dotnet test
```
to run tests.
